# Reed-Solomon Coding for Fault-Tolerance

This repository implements the logic presented in James S. Plank's paper, "A Tutorial on Reed-Solomon Coding for Fault-Tolerance in RAID-like Systems" [1]. The code aims to provide a practical and efficient solution for achieving high data availability and resilience in storage systems similar to RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks).

## Motivation

Traditional RAID uses data replication for fault tolerance, but this approach can be inefficient in terms of storage space, especially for large datasets. Reed-Solomon coding offers a more efficient alternative by utilizing erasure codes. These codes introduce additional parity information that allows for data reconstruction even with multiple disk failures, significantly reducing storage overhead compared to RAID.

## Key Features

- **Reed-Solomon coding implementation:** This code faithfully implements the core principles of Reed-Solomon coding, enabling efficient data encoding and decoding for fault tolerance.
- **Customizable parameters:** The code allows you to configure various parameters, such as the number of data and parity symbols, to tailor the solution to your specific storage requirements and desired redundancy level.

## Benefits

- **Improved storage efficiency:** By reducing redundancy overhead compared to RAID, this approach allows you to store more data using the same storage resources.
- **Enhanced data availability:** The ability to recover data from multiple disk failures ensures higher data availability and system uptime.
- **Customization and flexibility:** The configurable parameters make the code adaptable to diverse storage scenarios.

# Reed-Solomon Coding for Fault-Tolerance in RAID-like Systems

Reed-Solomon codes are widely recognized for their efficacy in providing error correction for multiple failures in RAID-like systems. While the coding technique is straightforward for coding theorists, it might pose a challenge for systems programmers lacking a background in coding theory. Existing references often assume familiarity with algebra and coding theory, making it inaccessible for those new to the field. This paper aims to bridge this gap by presenting a comprehensive coding algorithm specification and implementation details tailored for systems programmers. The goal is to enable the seamless implementation of Reed-Solomon coding for reliability in RAID-like systems without the need for external references.
